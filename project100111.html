                  Initially, when I entered my journey in dotnet the primary focus was on windform applications. 
                  The company I worked for had a solution that involved winform and a server solution around status management. It then seemed natural to me to work in this segment. Later I switched to developing in wpf which I felt was more appropriate as I have an interest in design.
                  My primary task then was to develop various support tools that the customers could use when they installed the solution where the server part was installed and configured on premise.

                <li class="m-top-2">I have also had a few short consulting assignments in MVC in different companies.</li>
                
                <li class="m-top-2">Last year I went on short education in net6 and web development where mvc was the primary framework. Since I have some experience with MVC, there was some parts I already knew about, but there was also parts that I had no experience with or completely forgotten. Overall it was a good education and I got a lot of good knowledge for future challenges.</li>

                <li class="m-top-2">
                  Way back in time I was initially getting my hands on java where where api was jdbc and the DB oracle . This mission lasted a few years and from that I got a relatively solid knowledge about oop. 
                  However, I have forgotten the most about java. As I said, it was a long time ago and when you don't work continuously with it, the knowledge disappears out in the space, unfourtunately.
