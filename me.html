              <p>
                I have a passion for development and design. It's always nice to have an idea that grows out of a thought segment into a reality. 
                A big reason why I am currently a developer is precisely that you have the opportunity to digitally create what you see. 
                It can be something you see online or out in real life. Nothing really sets any limits more than the need to keep up-to-date in 
                different technologies constantly as there are so many big changes all the time.<br/><br/>
                
                This particular aspect of full stack development is pleasant as it involves the entire spectrum from backend to frontend. 
                I enjoy this. But it's not like I can jump on any train I like as profound knowledge is required 
                within each framework, even from the same provider.<br/><br/>
                
                
                I have developed in Blazor for +4 years and then mainly in Wasm which I am most used to today. 
                I also have experience with Blazor server but then within a shorter span of experience.
                Blazor piqued my interest due to it was a component-based framework and also because you could only get by with C# and razor syntax alone. 
                These were the strongest reasons for me to start my journey with Blazor.<br/><br/>
                
                
                I now have some experience with javascript and think it's quite a fun language to develop in. 
                However, I'm not a pro and will probably stay at this level. All time is spent on dotnet development, 
                so my capacity and energy is quite limited to work my way up to a higher level in javascript. But one never know. 
                If taking some time to sit with javascript, one can probably get into it quite quickly. 
                I've noticed this when I developed for a short period in react with the advantage that I am used with Blazor development.  
                Since react and Blazor have many similarities, I could focus more on javascript instead of going through everything from the beginning.
                <br/><br>
                
                As a person, I am curious and like to explore completely new areas and new techniques without reservation. 
                Every now and then it's quite nice to let go of the old stuff of knowledge and try to find new angles on things.

                <br/><br/>
