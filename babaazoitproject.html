              <p>
                My first exposure to Blazor was in the second half of 2018. In 2019 I founded the company Babaazoit AB together with a business colleague whose business 
                idea was to build on a communication platform that I had started with earlier where the platform was Blazor Wasm as a hosted application - WebApi. Here I made fairly good use of signalR, 
                which works well for precisely this type of application where chat and other real-time services are used frequently.<br/><br/>

                The app, that was already existed as prospect was intended to be an educational project for my self where I got a good insight into how Blazor actually works behind the scenes, 
                which I enjoy today in terms of knowledge. Time passed and the project grew a lot over a few years. At first, Blazor wasm wasn't quite ready for this size of project. 
                The buildings took a long time so there was a lot of waiting during e.g the build took a long time to the point that the development suffered. 
                But a lot of positive things has happened since then.<br/><br/>
                
                As a dotnet developer, much was new to me when I started with Blazor. Not only that, Blazor was also in preview, which did not make it any less uncomplicated, 
                but It felt like Blazor was the right decision to move forward with its component structure similar to React and Angular. It simply felt like a framework adapted for the future.<br/><br/>
                
                
                The fun really started when we could start focusing on the services that the app would contain. We had some already working prospects but were a little unsure if it 
                would be feasible all the way considering that we did not know how Blazor would develop over time as it was still unofficially a lab framework. 
                When it became clear that Blazor was here to stay and Microsoft released the first RC, our planning could really take off.<br/><br/>
