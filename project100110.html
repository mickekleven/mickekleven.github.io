              <p>
                This was an interesting project where I was given overall responsibility for developing the site from scratch. 
                I didn't have much experience in web development at the time and saw this as a great opportunity to acquire 
                the skills I lacked in web programming. I found it both fun and educational. I managed to stick to the schedule 
                even though there was a lot of other stuff on my table that I wasn't really used to during this projekt. <br/><br/>

                Overall I'm satisfied with what i accomplished back then but today I whould have done everything, differently.
                 But off course, now I have these skills I lacked before and that makes a huge different, obviously.

              <ul>
                <li>Asyncronous calls for request and response</li>
                <li>ajax calls utilized for a better user experience where it's required</li>
                <li>Added a few web forms</li>
                <li>Design - Sass/css - responsive approach</li>
                <li>Implemented captha</li>
                <li>Implemented Google analytics</li>
                <li>DB design using migration - code first</li>

                <li>
                  I have a genuine long-term interest in photography and design, which probably led me onto the path as a 
                  full-stack developer as it also involves design. So from that point of view, it was a strategic choice I made 
                  to continue as a developer but where there are incentives from certain skills and interest to also work with design. 
                  So it was nice when I was also asked to be the photographer for some of the pictures on the site.
